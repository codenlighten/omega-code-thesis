## Abstract

This document serves as the **formal synthesis** of Omega Code v0.1, a computational metaphysics framework that demonstrates the structural equivalence between ancient metaphysical narratives and modern dynamical systems theory. Through executable code, rigorous testing, and visual validation, we have uncovered what may be the most uncomfortable truth in modern science:

> **The distance between mysticism and mathematics is notational, not metaphysical.**

What follows is not merely a code review—it is a **testament to the computational validation of philosophical principles** that have persisted across millennia but were never before rendered as falsifiable, executable systems.
